# FancyScroll - jQuery Plugin

## General Notes
In an effort to move the plugin forward, support for old jQuery version has been dropped.

Your old styles and properties *might not work out of the box*. Some property names have been changed, noted below, as well as namespacing prefixes being applied to all elements. This means that `.flex-direction-nav .next` is now `.flex-direction-nav .flex-next` by default. The namespacing property is exposed, free for you to change.

## Updates
